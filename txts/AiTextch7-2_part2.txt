Alternatively, we could say that the transition model itself is unknown because the agent doesn’t know which Forward actions are fatal—in which case, discovering the locations of pits and wumpus completes the agent’s knowledge of the transition model. For an agent in the environment, the main challenge is its initial ignorance of the configuration of the environment; overcoming this ignorance seems to require logical reasoning. In most instances of the wumpus world, it is possible for the agent to retrieve the gold safely. Occasionally, the agent must choose between going home empty-handed and risking death to find the gold. About 21% of the environments are utterly unfair, because the gold is in a pit or surrounded by pits.  Let us watch a knowledge-based wumpus agent exploring the environment shown in Figure 7.2 . We use an informal knowledge representation language consisting of writing down symbols in a grid (as in Figures 7.3 and 7.4 ). Figure 7.3 The first step taken by the agent in the wumpus world. (a) The initial situation, after percept [None,None,None,None,None]. (b) After moving to [2,1] and perceiving [None,Breeze,None,None,None]. Figure 7.4 Two later stages in the progress of the agent. (a) After moving to [1,1] and then [1,2], and perceiving [Stench,None,None,None,None]. (b) After moving to [2,2] and then [2,3], and perceiving [Stench,Breeze,Glitter,None,None].    The agent’s initial knowledge base contains the rules of the environment, as described previously; in particular, it knows that it is in [1,1] and that [1,1] is a safe square; we denote that with an “A” and “OK,” respectively, in square [1,1]. The first percept is [None,None,None,None,None], from which the agent can conclude that its neighboring squares, [1,2] and [2,1], are free of dangers—they are OK. Figure 7.3(a) shows the agent’s state of knowledge at this point. A cautious agent will move only into a square that it knows to be OK. Let us suppose the agent decides to move forward to [2,1]. The agent perceives a breeze (denoted by “B”) in [2,1], so there must be a pit in a neighboring square. The pit cannot be in [1,1], by the rules of the game, so there must be a pit in [2,2] or [3,1] or both. The notation “P?” in Figure 7.3(b) indicates a possible pit in those squares. At this point, there is only one known square that is OK and that has not yet been visited. So the prudent agent will turn around, go back to [1,1], and then proceed to [1,2]. The agent perceives a stench in [1,2], resulting in the state of knowledge shown in Figure 7.4(a) . The stench in [1,2] means that there must be a wumpus nearby. But the wumpus cannot be in [1,1], by the rules of the game, and it cannot be in [2,2] (or the agent would have detected a stench when it was in [2,1]). Therefore, the agent can infer that the wumpus is in [1,3]. The notation W! indicates this inference. Moreover, the lack of a breeze in [1,2] implies that there is no pit in [2,2]. Yet the agent has already inferred that there must be a pit in either [2,2] or [3,1], so this means it must be in [3,1]. This is a fairly difficult inference, because it combines knowledge gained at different times in different places and relies on the lack of a percept to make one crucial step. The agent has now proved to itself that there is neither a pit nor a wumpus in [2,2], so it is OK to move there. We do not show the agent’s state of knowledge at [2,2]; we just assume that the agent turns and moves to [2,3], giving us Figure 7.4(b) . In [2,3], the agent detects a glitter, so it should grab the gold and then return home. Note that in each case for which the agent draws a conclusion from the available information, that conclusion is guaranteed to be correct if the available information is correct. This is a fundamental property of logical reasoning. In the rest of this chapter, we     describe how to build logical agents that can represent information and draw conclusions such as those described in the
